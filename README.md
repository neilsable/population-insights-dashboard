## ✨ Overview

This project is a **fully self-designed analytics solution**, built entirely from scratch using **Microsoft Excel**.

I manually created a **realistic synthetic UK population dataset** and transformed it into a **stakeholder-ready dashboard** answering real-world questions around:
- demographics
- income and debt
- assets and net worth
- regional and sectoral differences

No pre-made datasets.  
No templates.  
Just **data design → analysis → insight → presentation**.

---

## 🎯 Why this project matters

In real analytics roles, the hardest part is not building charts — it’s:
> **structuring messy reality into decision-ready insight.**

This project demonstrates:
- how to **design data from zero**
- how to **ask the right questions**
- how to **translate raw numbers into insight**
- how to **present findings clearly to non-technical stakeholders**

---

## 🧠 What the dashboard answers

The dashboard is designed around **practical business and policy questions**, including:

- 👥 Gender distribution (men vs women)
- 🎂 Average age across the population
- 💷 Average income (overall, by sector, by county)
- 🚗 Average car value per person
- 🧾 Debt risk indicators:
  - % of people with **debts greater than annual income**
  - Count of people with **debts above a configurable threshold**
  - Count of people with **less than X% of mortgage left**
- 💰 Net worth insights:
  - Average age of people whose **net worth exceeds income**
  - Asset value vs debt exposure
- 🗺️ Regional insights:
  - Income distribution by UK county / territory
- 🏭 Sector insights:
  - Income differences across professions  
    (Health, Construction, Technology, Agriculture, Education, Social Services)

These questions mirror **real use cases** in:
- financial analysis
- public policy
- risk assessment
- market and population research

## 🧱 Data design & modelling

### Synthetic dataset (created manually)

The dataset simulates realistic distributions for:

- **Demographics**
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Education
  - Children
- **Financials**
  - Income
  - Debts
  - Assets
  - Net worth
- **Assets**
  - Car value

- **Geography**
  - UK counties / territories

The structure is **analysis-ready**, optimised for:
- pivot tables
- KPI calculations
- segmentation
- dashboard visuals

---

## 📐 Analytical thinking & KPIs

Key metrics were deliberately chosen to **tell a story**, not just show numbers:

- Gender counts and proportions
- Average age & income (overall and segmented)
- Income by sector and territory
- Debt-to-income risk metrics
- Mortgage completion indicators
- Net worth vs income relationships

Each KPI answers a **specific stakeholder question**.

---

## 📊 Excel dashboard design

The dashboard includes:
- A **dedicated dashboard sheet**
- Clearly separated:
  - Raw data
  - Calculations
  - Visual outputs
- Charts highlighting:
  - Sector distribution
  - Regional income variation
  - Debt and risk indicators
- Clean formatting:
  - Consistent currency & percentage formats
  - Logical grouping
  - Easy scanning for decision-makers

The focus is **clarity, not decoration**.

## 🛠️ Excel techniques used

- **Formulas**
  - `AVERAGE`, `AVERAGEIF`, `AVERAGEIFS`
  - `COUNTIF`, `COUNTIFS`
  - Percentage and ratio calculations
- **Pivot tables**
